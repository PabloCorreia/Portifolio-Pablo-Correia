# UVV Calculator Grades

This project was developed as part of the Introduction to Python Language course at Universidade Vila Velha (UVV). The "Grades Calculator" is an algorithm written in Python to manage the grades of students enrolled in an online course at UVV.

## Description

The program reads grades from 100 UVV EAD students for various assessments such as AOP1, AOP2, AOP3, regular exams, and recovery exams. Based on these grades, it calculates the status of each student (Approved, Recovery Exam, or Failed) and provides the percentage of students with different statuses within the class.

## Features

- Input of grades for different assessments.
- Calculation of the student's status.
- Displaying the percentage of students with different statuses in the class.

## How to Use

To test the program, follow these steps:
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter grades for each student as prompted.
3. Review the output displaying each student's status and the percentage of different statuses in the class.

## Additional Information

Receiving the maximum score on this activity was rewarding and proved the effectiveness of the work. This project was crucial for my approval in the discipline, providing a deeper understanding of programming logic and Python code structuring.

## Feedback

Feedback and comments are always welcome!
